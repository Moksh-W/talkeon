        Learning a new language is becoming increasingly more important as travel booms and the world gets closer and better connected via the Internet. Being bilingual or multilingual is an extremely beneficial and highly valued skill in this era. When we realized that current language learning apps just werenâ€™t cutting it, we decided to take the problem into our own hands. We noticed that many of our peers used language learning apps merely to farm streaks, not to really master new languages.
        Collectively, we have mastered over 10 languages and can converse in them fluently. We have improved upon other apps, creating a fluid and gamified experience for our customers to enjoy.

          With Talkeon, our goal is to create a platform that <b><i>ACTUALLY</i></b> helps you learn a language. It is fully customizable, and it lets you learn your way. To advance to the next part of the course, you can earn points by practicing in five different skill trees: grammar, speaking, reading, writing, and listening. We have tried our best to make the process of mastering a new language easy.
